fairly earnest discussion of the community experience, he put up his hand and said
âBy the way, I can get you really cheap Viagra and Cialis.â  It was the best

<p>I spend a mainstream amount of time reading magazines and watching TV, and
a more-than-mainstream amount reading the Net.  Of all the
teeming billions of dollars poured into advertising on all these media, essentially none
of it speaks to me.  This was brought home yesterday when I was impressed by two
ads in one day.  They were running this TV ad for Subway (the sandwich shop)
that was just incredibly simple and linear: âUnlike
McDonalds and the others, we make our bread fresh every day in the storeâ;
with a picture of the oven.  I
havenât been to a Subway in decades, but the next time Iâve got hungry cranky
kids to wrangle, thatâs maybe a good argument for giving them a try.
The same evening, I was looking through my newsfeeds, and in 
<cite>The Economistâs</cite> excellent
<a href="http://www.economist.com/debate/freeexchange/">Free Exchange</a> blog
(yeah, dust off your knee-jerk right-silliness filter, but still) feed, one of the
entries was an ad; a simple one-paragraph squib saying there was a special
offer for new subscribers.  I already subscribe, but you couldnât
imagine a better way to pitch a subscription.  Two in one day?  Thatâs the
first time thatâs happened in years.</p>

<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>The buzz around OpenID is becoming impossible to ignore.  If you donât know
why, check out 
<a href="http://simonwillison.net/2006/openid-screencast/">How To Use
OpenID</a>, a
screencast by Simon Willison.
As itâs used now (unless Iâm missing something) OpenID seems pretty
useless, but with only a little work (unless Iâm missing something) it
could be very useful indeed.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Problem: TLS</h2>
<p>The first problem is that OpenID doesnât require the use of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a>
(whatâs behind URIs that begin with <code>https:</code>).  Doing anything
remotely connected with authentication over an unencrypted link where you
canât be sure who youâre talking to seems all wrong to me.
I see that this subject is under discussion (<a href="http://jyte.com/cl/openid-providers-should-use-tls-whenever-possible">here</a>
and
<a href="http://lists.danga.com/pipermail/yadis/2005-July/001273.html">here</a>)
in the community.</p>
<p>The fact that apparently-sane people think it might
sometimes be OK to not use TLS makes me think thereâs something obvious Iâm
missing.  In Simonâs screencast, the pages that you type your OpenID into are
unsecured; hmmm.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Problem: Whatâs It Mean?</h2>
<p>Another problem with OpenID is that, well, having one doesnât mean very
much; just that you can verify that some server somewhere says it believes that the
person operating the browser owns that ID.</p>
<p>Unless Iâm missing something, as a thought experiment I could set up a
bogus OpenID server at <code>http://www.tbray.org/silly-id/</code>, and
arrange that when queried about any OpenID whatsoever beginning with that URI,
it instantly provided a positive response.  For example,
<code>http://www.tbray.org/silly-id/BillGates</code> or
<code>http://www.tbray.org/sill-id/PopeBenedictXVI</code>.  None of that nasty
time-consuming authentication stuff; sure would speed up logging into
OpenID-supporting sites.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Problem: Phishing</h2>
<p>This is going to be a problem, but I donât think itâs fair to hang it on
OpenID, because itâs going to be equally a problem with <em>any</em>
browser-based authentication.  Since browser-based authentication is What The
People Want, weâre just going to have to fight through this with a combination of
browser engineering and (more important) educating the general public.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>What Could I Use It For Today?</h2>
<p>Hereâs what I think Iâd be willing to do: in the commenting system here at
<span class='o'>ongoing</span>, Iâd be inclined, if I had manually approved a
comment with someone whoâd authenticated via OpenID, to subsequently accept
further comments from that OpenID, unmoderated.</p>
<p>I canât think of anything else.</p>
<h2 id='p-5'>Solution: TLS</h2>
<p>Just Do It.  Create a culture where traffic is simply expected to be
encrypted and secure for each step in the authentication chain.  If thereâs
anything in the protocol that makes this hard, fix it.  Yes, anyone
offering authentication services will have to own and manage a cert.  That is
the entry-level price for me taking you seriously.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>Solution: Meaning Something</h2>
<p>I havenât actually heard anyone argue that all OpenIDs should be considered
equal to all others, which is good, because that would be a profoundly silly
idea.</p>
<p>For some given application, I might be willing to support LiveJournal
OpenIDs but not those from MyOpenID; or vice versa.  There might be an
opportunity for some sort of independent-security-audit business, rating
quality of OpenID providers.  Bruce Schneier, where are you?</p>
<p>Once again, maybe Iâm missing something, but it seems obvious that if
OpenID is ever going to be much use for real work in applications that
matters, there are going to be whitelists of ID Providers.  Does anyone see
this as a problem?  If not, all the libraries out there Ruby and Python and
PHP and so on need to have the provider-whitelist feature built in.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>The Real Problem</h2>
<p>Of course, out there in the enterprise space where most of Sunâs customers
live, they think about identity problems at an entirely different level.
Single-sign-on seems like a little and not terribly interesting piece of the
problem.  They lose sleep at night over âAttribute Exchangeâ; once you have an
identity, who is allowed to hold what pieces of information about you, and
what are the right protocols by which they may be requested, authorized, and
delivered?  The technology is tough, but the policy issues are
mind-boggling.</p>  
<p>So at the moment I suspect that OpenID isnât that interesting to those
people.   But Web-heads like me care about Plain Old Single Sign-on, and we
like identifying ourselves by URI.  So OpenID might scratch a pretty big
itch.</p>
<p>Unless Iâm missing something.  The reason I keep saying that is that I
really am an Identity newbie.  Iâm sure my commenters will be diligent in
pointing out where Iâve gone off the rails.</p>

<p>You know, if I didnât care so much about 
<a href="http://www.economist.com">The Economist</a>, I wouldnât be
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/08/13/Economist-QA">giving it grief</a>
here.  If the word âjournalismâ means anything, it should mean
<em>quality</em>; I expect that my (expensive) subscription buys me a magazine
that I often expect to disagree with but which is thoughtful, well-researched,
well-written, and well-edited.  I donât <em>want</em> to abandon journalism,
but these guys are dropping their end of the bargain.</p>
<p>A recent
<a href="http://www.economist.com/surveys/displayStory.cfm?story_id=8513949">Survey on Executive Pay</a> (thatâs a subscriber-only link), 
dives at length, and with details, into the perceived abuse of shareholders by
executives, points out the keenest abuses and (this being <cite>The
Economist</cite>) offers some arguments as to why
this might not be as bad as it looks.</p>
<p>Some of them are sort of coherent, but then you get this: âThe role of pay
is not to get executives to work harder (most are workaholics already, toiling
towards an appointment with the heart surgeon), but to recruit good managers
and get them to take difficult decisions. Shutting a subsidiary, sacrificing a
pet project or forgoing a tempting acquisition is not much fun. Without the
spur of high pay, managers tend to avoid such things.â  Uh, evidence, please?  Even
<em>anecdotal</em> evidence?  This is kind of the center of the whole
argument, and thereâs no there there.</p>
<p>Next, for your amusement, is the following advertisement taken from the
current issueâs right-up-front âExecutive Focusâ section, which is mostly
recruiting for high-level jobs (it shares a page with ads from the UN and Save the
Children).</p>
<img src="e-ms.png" alt="Microsoft ad from the Economist" />
<p>To start with, itâs in the wrong place in the magazine.  
And this
Microsoft âPeople Readyâ campaign is pathetically awful, into brain-damage
territory. 
Ah, but editorial and advertising are different parts of the shop, right?
That might be true, except for
the ad clearly suggests that <cite>The Economist</cite> has
bought into this âpeople-readyâ vapidity and is writing articles about it.
Not so, fortunately; if you follow the link, the page you end up
at is regurgitated <cite>Economist</cite> articles from the last few years, not
particularly interesting, in a dense frame of Microsoft ads.
And finally, they canât spell âitsâ.</p>
<p>Really, really, offensive.</p>
<p>Dear <cite>Economist</cite>:  I donât buy your beautifully-typeset dead trees
and steal whatever time it takes to read most of each issue, and put up with
your knee-jerk right-wing thought filters, to be presented with this kind of crap.
If I want unsupported assertions, lame-ass Microsoft marketing, and lousy
spelling, I have the whole Internet to choose from.  You need to be better.</p>

<p>When I first threw the switch and opened the <span class='o'>ongoing</span>
space to contributors, my Atom feed included comment counts.
Thus, every time someone commented, subscribers saw the
article again in their feed-readers.  This was unpopular (check out the discussion 
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/06/On-Comments">here</a> and
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/10/08/On-Comments">here</a>) so I removed them. 
But now Iâm unhappy with that decision.</p>
<p>The trouble is, I know that very few people subscribe to my
<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/comments.atom">comments feed</a>, and I
also know that for quite a few of the fragments here, if you cared enough
about the subject to read the original, you really <em>really</em> want to go
back and read the comments too, because individually or in sum, they outweigh my
contribution.</p>
<p>For example, if you care about trends in high-end pocket cameras, the
comments on
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/02/19/Camera-Blues">Camera Blues</a> are a
treasure trove.  And if you care about the future of XML, the discussion on
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/01/30/XML-2">XML 2.0?</a> is essential.</p>
<p>Itâs also troubling that I advertise my Atom feed as âfull-contentâ but
itâs really not, because it omits theâessential, in my opinionâcontributions
from others.</p>
<p>Last time the discussion came up, people felt that I ought to perform an
editorial function; update the article when I thought there were particularly
insightful comments that were especially noteworthy.  Nope, doesnât scale.
First of all, the writing I do here consumes pretty well all the available
cycles and second, Iâd end up doing it for almost every piece.</p>
<p>So, as a compromise between what I want and what my audience wants, I think
Iâm going to start flagging the comments in the feed; but only once every
other day, and Iâll skip the first day.
Since the commenting, even when itâs voluminous, is usually over with quick,
on average youâll only see each article twice in your feed-reader.</p>
<p>So, what should I put in the feed?  I see three options:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Just the number of comments.</p></li>
<li><p>The full text of all the comments; then the feed would <em>really</em>
be âfull-contentâ.</p></li>
<li><p>Update the comment form to accept an optional âsummaryâ field, and
include that in the feed.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Simpler is better, so I tend to lean to #2.  What do you think?</p>
<p><i>[Update:]</i> I think that the first comment below points at the right
answer, so I just added another comment outlining what I think Iâll do.</p>

which just rolls off the tongue, doesnât it.   I have to say itâs about the
butchiest-looking NIC Iâve ever seen.
Now, normally I would have bypassed the opportunity to blog, because Iâve never
actually even seen a 10G wire or plug, and have no idea what the trade-offs
are and what makes a good one.  But our Ariel Hendel wrote
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/hendel/entry/russian_dolls">Russian Dolls</a>,
the first paragraph of which discusses love, soccer, and beer, and which includes

<h2 id='p-2'>Disintermediation</h2>
<p>Assuming that Web disclosure were fair and accurate 
and timely, nobody could be against it, right?  Well, it
would be a classic case of disintermediation and thus threatening to
intermediaries, for example
<a href="http://home.businesswire.com/">BusinessWire</a>
and
<a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/">PR Newswire</a>.
They are in the business of collecting news releases from companies and
disseminating them to subscribers, who include journalists and the financial
community.
I donât know how big a business it is.  Back when I was running a
startup, it was a couple of thousand dollars to do a press release, but big
companies usually have fixed-price annual deals; Iâd assume Sun does.
I donât know about the costs to subscribers.</p>
<p>Note that Mark Hynes, who wrote
<a href="http://transparencymatters.blogspot.com/2006/11/bad-idea-for-issuers-and-for-investors.html"> A bad idea for issuers and for investors</a>,
is in Investor Relations for PR Newswire.  Which doesnât mean that his
arguments are wrong, it just means that heâs unlikely to be neutral; but then,
neither am I.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Cox: Be Careful</h2>
<p>Chairman Coxâs letter said âamong the questions that would
need to be addressed is whether there exist effective means to guarantee that
a corporation uses its website in ways that assure broad non-exclusionary
access, and the extent to which a determination that particular methods are
effective in that regard depends on the particular facts.â 
Which I would translate as âWeâd have to ensure that the disclosure is really
fairâ, and Iâd agree with fully.</p>
<p>Given that financial players can squeeze big-bucks advantages out of
getting their hands on hot financial info just a little bit ahead of the
market, and that there are powerful incentives to lie &amp; cheat &amp; steal for many
of the players in the system, both on the company side and the investor side,
this has to be done carefully.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Incumbent: Bad Idea</h2>
<p>PR Newswireâs Mr. Hynes
<a href="http://transparencymatters.blogspot.com/2006/11/bad-idea-for-issuers-and-for-investors.html">raises</a> ten potential problems,
saying that in the past, such ideas have been âshown to be unworkable, and
replaced with the tried and tested option of properly distributed press
releases serving the financial services community best.â  If you care about 
this, you should go his essay.
Speaking only for myself, I think some of his points are good and others
are bogus; Iâve addressed them below.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Accountability and the Market</h2>
<p>It seems that that if you were going to Web-enable Reg FD,
the key point would be accountability:
making it entirely clear that should the fairness or transparency of the
disclosure be compromised by a companyâs web-site, or a
financial playerâs use of it, the misbehaving party can be held
accountable.</p>
<p>Given that, unless thereâs some awful technical flaw, why wouldnât we give
it a try?  PR Newswire and BizWire argue strenuously that they can serve
companies and investors better.  If so, then the market will speak and both
sides will continue to choose their services, rather than using
the Web to bypass them.</p>
<p><i>[Disclosure: Iâm biased; instinctively suspicious of
gatekeepers, intermediaries, and monopolies.  Iâd really like the to do this
on the Web.  But Chairman Cox is right: we have to be careful.]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-5'>The Contra Position</h2>
<p>Iâll take the liberty of quoting Mark Hynesâ points in full and addressing
them one by one. (Hereâs a chance for my expert commenters to point out why
Iâm wrong.)
He opens with a question:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Why has the concept been found wanting? Here
are 10 reasons.</i></p>
<p><i>1. Push versus pull. A posting on a website requires investors
to proactively set up to receive the information. This has consequences such
as the institutional market (with greater resources to do this) being better
informed than retail, creating selective disclosure.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Everyone agrees that material releases would have
to happen at a pre-announced time.  If you cared about a large number of
companies that were releasing at the same moment, this might be a problem; but
for the typical retail investor, how hard can it be to watch a well-known
website at a well-known time?  Iâd think that for the <em>retail</em>
investor, disintermediation would be a win.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>2. Formatting. No matter what format is loaded on to the
website, it will
inconvenience some part of the media and delivery chain, reducing the
visibility of news in the multitudes of media. The equity terminals are
notoriously inflexible in catching news from multiple, random sources. Reuters
et al are highly unlikely to redesign their entire editorial processes to
accommodate this notion.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>This is a hypothetical.  <em>If</em> the media are unwilling to go
gather news directly from company web-sites and canât handle formats
like HTML and Atom, then presumably theyâll be happy to go on subscribing
to PR Newswire.  I canât imagine retail investors worrying much.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>3. Validation/ editorial checking. There is well-substantiated evidence that show the number of occasions on which a release - fully approved by the company - has mistakes. 3rd party eyes and ears can help ensure that incorrect information does not reach the markets.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>This is an excellent point; speaking as one with long-time experience in
reference publishing, Iâm aware of the fact that you keep turning up
significant errors even after multiple proof-reading passes; and an error in a
material financial release could really hurt.
Of course, at the end of the day, the accountability for errors has to be with
the originator of the information.  Still, assuming that PR Newswireâs
customers find value in this, it should be decoupled from the
information-pump function and offered as a separate service.  I suspect that it
would be of significant value to many companies.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>4. Security of posting. Is the person posting the release on the issuer's website entitled to do so? Would every company have to create restricted zones for IR, corporate secretary etc?</i></p></blockquote>
<p>This seems entirely bogus to me.  Is the person sending the release to PR
Newswire entitled to do so?  Doesnât every company currently have to create special
press-releasing roles for IR, corporate secretary etc?   Of course.  Plus, any
reasonably well-managed company already has some sort of access-control
protocol in place for its website; I guarantee that I wouldnât be allowed to
update Sunâs
<a href="http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/investor/index.jsp">Investor
Relations</a> page.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>5. Role of financial PR companies. Financial PR companies post large numbers of results releases to the newswires. Would every company expect to give the PR companies access to the (secure) area of their website?</i></p></blockquote>
<p>I think itâs worth the experiment of giving companies the option (remember,
weâre talking about an option, not a compulsory mandate) of posting their own
numbers without going through a PR company.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>6. Down time. No single source can be relied upon 100% - the newswires have (had to) invest in redundancy of systems, ensuring permanent access. Not every company will have the resources to do this, and smaller caps are especially vulnerable.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>This is another good point; lots of companiesâ websites are mostly
brochure-ware and donât have the kind of redundancy that the CFO 
would require.  Others do.  Those who need help present another
business opportunity for experts such as PR Newswire and BizWire.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>7. Access to the 'editorial process'. Journalists work in many different ways, some on email, some using newswires, some on fax etc, with a constantly moving population. It is unreasonable to expect all companies to keep up to date with journalist changes, or to develop multiple mechanisms to deliver to these different audiences. And expecting investors and journalists to re-register is frankly unrealistic.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>In my experience, almost all unsolicited press releases are simply ignored
by almost all journalists.  Those that really matterâfor example, financial
results from public companiesâare actively sought out by those who
cover the companies.  
I see no reason why a journalist covering a
particular release would care much whether theyâre getting it from a companyâs
website or the current intermediaries.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>8. New media types are constantly emerging - it is in the commercial interests of the newswire to constantly patrol for these media, and harness them. Would all quoted companies be as diligent?</i></p></blockquote>
<p>What Mr. Hynes
is discussing here is either journalismâproactively going after a storyâor
feed filtering such as is now provided by Technorati and its competitors.  I
donât see what either has to do with material financial disclosures; for those,
Reg FD makes it clear that itâs the responsibility of the company to
ensure proactively that these be available, timely and fair.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>9. Simultaneity. The principles of good disclosure - never mind the law of the land - requires news to be accessible to all investors at the same time. This would be impossible for companies to achieve.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>This is Mr. Hynesâ single best point, I think.   I donât know enough to
know whether heâs right, but I bet somebody who reads this does.
What are the service-level guarantees that the incumbents provide?  For
example, when HPQâs quarterlies cross the wires, if Iâm a stock-market dabbler
on DSL in Bend, Oregon, how many microseconds is the lag between the time when a
Goldman Sachs trader sees them and I do?  The maximum tolerable lag between
Goldman Sachs and Bear Stearns?</p>
<p>Given a clean definition of the acceptable information
latencies, itâll be an interesting question how well the Web can do.  It might
not be good enough to just post the release on the corporate server in Mountain View
or Raleigh or wherever, there might be a case for Akamai-style
infrastructure.</p>
<p>It also dawns on me that when you get the quarterlies, the real-world
latency is the time it takes you to plow through all the earnest corporate
bumph at the top and get to the actual numbers that are actionable for you.
To reduce it, the smart thing to do is to start sending the data in XML so
that you can pre-program your computer to show you what you care about in a
fraction of a second.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>10. These challenges will inevitably hurt smaller companies most, a) by increasing cost to enhance their websites to the necessary degree, and b) investors will access large companies first; an investment story from a smaller company will win less prominence, ultimately strangling some prematurely, due to less access to capital.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Iâm sorry, but absent the evidence, the above are just
unsupported assertions.</p>
<h2 id='p-6'>My View</h2>
<p>I suspect delivering financials to investors is a
corporate function that will probably end up being largely outsourced, as it
is today.  Now is the time to try basing this delivery
on open Web infrastructure rather than the proprietary pipes of a few
incumbent gatekeepers.  That way thereâs room for 
competition, and thus improved business performance, at both ends of the
pipe.</p>
<h2 id='p-7'>What Do You Think?</h2>
<p>This dialogue is now in progress.  On the evidence, both the corporate and
government sides of it are listening.   If we can figure out how to make the
Web do what companies and investors need, I think thereâs a chance to remove
some friction from the investment economy.</p>

<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>Both my cameras are having problems so Iâm grumpy; Iâm cheering myself
up by watching the digicam market, appreciating what I have, and enjoying
flash photography.</p>
<p>Letâs start with the good stuff.  
Back in December I
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/12/27/Christmas-Pictures#p-2">wrote</a> about
the joys of using a flash bounce-card.  Itâs totally the single biggest step
forward in my camera technique in years.</p>
<img src="IMGP4658.png" alt="The seven lucky gods" />
<div class="caption"><p>The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Lucky_Gods">Seven Lucky Gods</a>,
a gift from
<a href="http://www.shimane-oss.org/">Open Source Shimane</a>.</p></div>
<p>For anyone who hasnât figured this out yet, start doing it, itâs easy.  You
grab a piece of white paper and figure out a way to hold it up to the front of
your camera so that it bounces the light from the flash off to the side,
ideally against a not-too-distant reasonably-light-colored surface.
You could carry around a prepared piece of paper, but I just
use the nearest business card or envelope or whatever, and usually get good
results; in the picture above, a monthly bank statement.
The magic that makes it work is that digicams fire the flash twice, the
first time to set the meter; so it figures out how to compensate for whatever
weirdo lighting effect youâve created.</p>
<p>Most of my interior shots are the kids so I wonât show them to you, which
is a pity because Iâve been getting perfect warm creamy flesh-tones almost
every time.</p>
<p>So I have a question; why donât the cameras come with built-in
apparatus to do this automatically?  Most digicam flash pictures come out
bleached and glaring and awful.  For example, those Seven Lucky Gods have a
pretty pleasing colour balance to my eye; contrast the horrid lighting 
in 

<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2007/02/09/Shimane">the dinner-table photo</a>
of one of the visitors who brought them over;
for some reason I didnât use a flash card.</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Pocket Camera</h2>
<p>My darling
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/11/17/S70">Canon S70</a> is sick;
the zoom control sometimes zooms, sometimes doesnât.  Itâs been in my pocket
more or less every day since 2004, in some really inhospitable places; Iâve
used it on beaches and in rainstorms and prairie blizzards and dropped it a
couple of times.  It doesnât look as bad as
<a href="http://photo.net/photodb/photo?photo_id=1046936">Willie Nelsonâs
guitar</a>, but it doesnât look good.
I guess Iâll try to get it repaired but Iâm not that optimistic.</p>
<p>I have to say that, four years after
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/06/01/S50">getting into</a> this camera
format, Iâm still in love with it.  Itâs a pocket cam, itâll do point-and-shoot
all right, but itâs a bit bigger, a bit fatter, has pretty extreme wide-angle
capabilities and as much manual control as you want to exercise.</p>
<p>Sure, other things being equal, the big Pentax DSLR is more flexible
and can capture a more beautiful image.  But other things are notably unequal, in
that the pocket cam is always there in my pocket when the beautiful image
occurs.</p>
<p>Thereâs a problem in that if the S70 is toast, itâs not obvious what to
replace it with.  The follow-on S80 has been well-reviewed, but doesnât do
RAW.  Announced in 2005, itâs getting a little elderly and notably doesnât
have image stabilization, which is basically the only really interesting new
digicam feature to have arrived in the last couple of years.</p>
<p>Thereâs not much else in the niche; Digital Photo Review, on which I rely
perhaps a little more than I should,
<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasoniclx2/">savaged the Panasonic
LX2</a>.  Hmm, I see that the about-to-arrive
<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0702/07022006_nikonp5000.asp">Nikon
P5000</a> is in a similar niche, and the
<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0608/06082103pentaxa20.asp">Pentax
A20</a> is also a candidate.  Also, I bet that thereâll be a Canon S90 pretty
soon.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>DSLR</h2>
<p>I havenât regretted for a moment snapping up the
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2004/05/16/PentaxDSLR">Pentax *ist D</a> in early 2005.
Itâs been a complete joy to work with, and I still havenât come close to
putting all the things it can do to work.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, thereâs some dust on the sensor nowâyou can only see it
against a flat background like sky or skin, and you can usually correct it
with Photoshop, but itâs really irritatingâso something has to be done.  
Apparently, you 
<a href="http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/visible-dust.shtml">can
sweep out
your cameraâs innards yourself</a>, but Iâm a little fumble-fingered and a lot
impatient and the notion makes me nervous.  Hmm, the *ist Dâs ownerâs manual
has detailed instructions, it doesnât sound <em>that</em> hairy.</p>
<p>Gosh, I observe that the reviews on the
<a href="http://www.pentaximaging.com/products/product_details/digital_camera--*ist_DL/reqID--8793673/subsection--digital_slr">Pentax
K10D</a> are positively glowing.  Also that it has image stabilization.  Also
that it has a self-cleaning sensor.  Down, boy.</p>

<h2 id='p-2'>Issues</h2>
<p>As it says above, there are some.  First of all, Iâm only counting the
number of subscribers to my Atom 1.0 feed, not my no-longer-present
permanently-redirected RSS feed.  I think the biggest sufferer is NetVibes,
which drops 354.</p>
<p>Second, several of the services, notably Google and NewsGator, report what
seem to be multiple different groups of subscribers to my Atom feed.   A few
of them are kind of understandable: two slashes instead of one,
<code>www.tbray.org</code> vs. <code>tbray.org</code>, and a few to
<code>/ongoing/ongoing.atom?foo=bar</code> (huh?); but for example Google,
which helpfully labels each group with a unique <code>feed-id</code>, suggests
that several different ones apply to
<code>http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/ongoing.atom</code>.  Beats me.  This may
lead to a little inaccuracy when adding up other multi-subscribers like
NewsGator; but wouldnât change the ranking, I think.</p>
<h2 id='p-3'>Rah Rah Bloglines</h2>
<p>Apparently the programmers of Bloglinesâ robots are the only ones who have
taken the trouble to read RFC2616 and RFC3986 (especially Section 6 of the
latter); they handle all the redirects and variations correctly and only know
about two ways to subscribe to me, the right one, and twenty subscribers to
that <code>?foo=bar</code> anomaly.</p>
<h2 id='p-4'>Unclear On The Concept</h2>
<p>There are a few people whoâve subscribed to URIs that donât exist, or
arenât feeds: <code>/ongoing/</code> itself, my <code>robots.txt</code>,
<code>ongoing.pie</code> (snicker), random pictures;
thatâd be part of your Internet Background Radiation.</p>

<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>What happened was, I got a note from my friend
<a href="http://www.inthachamber.com/">Adam</a> 
âVuduâ (<a href="http://www.myspace.com/echodub">MySpace</a>) about his
new CD 
<a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/echomusic2">echo :: dubstyle</a>.
I have a soft spot for dub and liked the samples, so I hit the âBuyâ button.
The record is good, a huge bargain at $12.97, go get it.  But the buying
experience was out of the ordinary.</p>
<img src="echo-dubstyle.png" alt="echo: dubstyle" class="inline" />
<h2 id='p-2'>The Music</h2>
<p>I understand there are people out there who donât like dub; how
unfortunate.  This isnât my favorite dub recordâthat would be <cite>Dub the
Rock</cite> by
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2003/09/23/IsraelVibration">Israel
Vibration</a>âbut itâs a keeper.  Itâs traditional, Adamâs not trying to push
back the edges of the medium.
There are some surprising bass tracksâthatâs
his home instrumentâplus he he works the soundstage well and keeps the textures
shifting, without ever losing that heavy dub lilt.</p>
<p>I was listening while writing, and track 8, <cite>Sidestep Dub</cite>,
yanked my attention away from the computer; itâs got some intelligent cool-electronica
punctuation and I was sad when it ended.</p>
<p>There are fourteen dubs here, then eight are offered again in âslowedâ
(with a credit to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Screw">DJ Screw</a> for the notion)
versions.
I ainât anywhere near hip enough to know about screwing or slowing, but eight
more dub tracks is a good thing.  I zeroed on on my fave <cite>Sideways
Dub</cite> and I like it both screwed and unscrewed.  This is a good
thing.</p>
<p>Like I said, a bargain.
(Potential purchasers should bear in mind that a
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/03/02/Totem">serious subwoofer</a> will
enhance the listening experience.)</p>
<h2 id='p-1'>The Commerce</h2>
<p>The online purchase sequence at
<a href="http://cdbaby.com/">CD Baby</a>
doesnât stand out in my memory, but a few
minutes later I got this email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subject: CD Baby Loves Tim</p>
<p>Tim -</p>
<p>Thanks for your order with CD Baby!</p>
<p>This is just a happy automated email to let you know a real person
will email you as soon as your package is sent, and you will also
receive a paper receipt with  your order in the mail.</p>
<p>Please save this email in case you have any questions about your
order.</p>
<p>** NOTE: if any of the info below looks wrong, please hit REPLY now
to let us know!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I liked the honesty about automated vs. personal email, and the notion
of encouraging you to mail back if somethingâs wrong; refreshing!</p>
<p>Then the next day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subject: CD Baby Loves Tim</p>
<p>Tim -</p>
<p>Thanks for your order with CD Baby!</p>
<p><i>[... details omitted ... ]</i></p>
<p>Your CD has been gently taken from our CD Baby shelves with
sterilized contamination-free gloves and placed onto a satin pillow.</p>
<p>A team of 50 employees inspected your CD and polished it to make sure
it was in the best possible condition before mailing.</p>
<p>Our packing specialist from Japan lit a candle and a hush fell over
the crowd as he put your CD into the finest gold-lined box that money
can buy.</p>
<p>We all had a wonderful celebration afterwards and the whole party
marched down the street to the post office where the entire town of
Portland waved 'Bon Voyage!' to your package, on its way to you, in
our private CD Baby jet on this day, Wednesday, January 31st.</p>
<p>I hope you had a wonderful time shopping at CD Baby.  We sure did.
Your picture is on our wall as 'Customer of the Year'.  We're all
exhausted but can't wait for you to come back to CDBABY.COM!!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, about the same day I got the disk, I got one more:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subject: CD Baby Loves Tim</p>
<p>Tim -</p>
<p>Did you get your CD OK?
Was everything perfect?</p>
<p>If you liked a CD you bought, please write a little review on the
musician's CD Baby page?  Just click the link below, and scroll to
the bottom of the page. You'll see where it says, "WRITE A REVIEW".
It only takes a minute and would mean a lot to the artists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, thatâs what Internet commerce ought to be like: prompt, friendly, and
smart.</p>

<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p>As usual, there isnât a unifying theme.  In this issue: lumpiness, stuff,
microformats, eye candy, metaprogramming, beards, and psychology.</p>
<p>Letâs start with Paul Kedroskyâs
<a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2007/02/03/building_the_pe.html">Building
the Perfect Board Package</a>, which quotes a âsales-guru colleagueâ as saying
the following: âLumpy is not a fact of life in enterprise sw companies - lumpy
companies should never go public.â  Jeepers, can that be right?  Iâve never
been in Oracleâs board-room, but enterprise SW traditionally has been one of
the lumpiest businesses there is that doesnât involve building nuclear power
plants or Olympic facilities.  While weâre on the subject of surprising things
in Mr. Kâs vicinity, he wrote a
<a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB117106313810704156-oOFOzhK1KpRAztO1N0QjS9J70F4_20070217.html?mod=blogs">Wall
Street Journal Op-Ed</a> that concludes with âAnd Mr. Jobs knows that there is
pretty much zero chance the music industry will eliminate DRM. That move would
sound a death ringtone for their struggling business, making online piracy
dead simple and destroy the livelihood of an entire generation of artists.â
For the record, a high proportion of people who are educated about the issues
and donât work for record companies do <em>not</em> believe that DRM is 
about helping artistsâ livelihoods.</p>
<p>Moving on, check out my brother Robâs
<a href="http://takingalongview.blogspot.com/2007/02/vapourings-about-stuff.html">essay
on, uh, stuff</a>, which despite its offhand tone says (I think) some fairly
profound things.</p>
<p>Back to business.  Several people have now asked me to think about CotÃ©âs
<a href="http://www.redmonk.com/cote/2007/01/31/rfp-microformat/">RFP
Microformat</a> proposal.  The idea is compelling, all right.  How would one
build critical mass?  Hmmm.</p>
<p>While weâre still in Redmonk country, check out Steve OâGradyâs
<a href="http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2007/02/10/finally-some-linux-eye-candy/">Finally, Some Linux Eye Candy</a>.
Gotta get me some of that on my Ubuntu box.  I suspect that in the pretty near
future, this kind of UI will be a requirement for personal computers that want
to be taken seriously.  Glad that
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/harpster/entry/beryl">Harpster agrees</a>.</p>
<p>Letâs visit Rubyland.  At <cite>Practical Ruby</cite> thereâs
<a href="http://practicalruby.blogspot.com/2007/02/ruby-metaprogramming-introduction.html">A Ruby Metaprogramming Introduction</a>;
interestingly, they want you to drop the entry into your programming editor
rather than read it in your browser.  So far it looks good.</p>
<p>Those outside the Ruby community have occasionally remarked that the
culture seems, well, a little weird.  Theyâre wrong; in fact itâs extremely
weird.  Set your weirdness-tolerance level to the absolute maximum and check
out
<a href="http://poignantguide.net/ruby/chapter-7.html">When You Wish Upon a
Beard</a> by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff">why the lucky
stiff</a>.  In among the cartooning are koans like
<code>"!pleH".send(:reverse)</code>.</p>
<p>Letâs close with a bang, namely Bruce Schneierâs
<a href="http://www.schneier.com/essay-155.html">The Psychology of Security</a>.
Itâs large and it covers its subject exhaustively and uncompromisingly.  Youâll
need to set aside a chunk of time to read it, and you should read it.</p>

<p>Acronyms are funny.  In LAMP, everything (but, it seems, the âAâ) is

<p>Anyone who cares at all about taking advantage of these nasty new
microprocessors that still follow Mooreâs law but sideways not just straight
up ought to go and read
<a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2006/EECS-2006-183.html">The Landscape of Parallel Computing Research: A View from Berkeley</a>.
As the title suggests, itâs an overview paper.  Thank goodness we have
universities, so that smart people who know about this stuff can invest a few
months in surveying the landscape and report back for the rest of us who are
being whipped around by the market maelstrom.
Herewith <em>way</em> too much applause and disagreement and
expansion.</p>
<p><i>[First off, thanks to Liang Chen; Iâd been meaning to get around to
looking at this for a while, and he slapped a printed copy down in front of
me, which got me started.]</i></p>
<h2 id='p-1'>Logistics</h2>
<p>This is a big, thick, dense paper; I had to read it in fits and starts
while doing lots of other things and I lost track, but I bet it added up to a
couple of hours.  Also, thereâs a
<a href="http://view.eecs.berkeley.edu/wiki/Main_Page">supporting wiki</a>
and a
<a href="http://view.eecs.berkeley.edu/blog/">blog</a>,
although Iâm not clear whether the paper represents the conclusion of the wiki
process, or whether the material in the wiki reflects further thought.</p>
<h2 id='p-2'>Crunchy Research Goodness</h2>
<p>Maybe the best thing here for me is that the survey covers a bunch of research
that Iâd missed.   Iâm sure lots of my readers knew the
following, but I didnât:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Internal system bandwidth is increasing much faster than latency,
they say âat least the square of the improvement in latencyâ.</p></li>
<li><p>Cisco has been drawing a lot of attention with their Metro chip:
188 small cores based on 130nm technologies.</p></li>
<li><p>There are some neat calculations from Amdahlâs law to suggest that
making the cores on your chip non-uniform, as in having one thatâs a lot
faster than the rest, can pay off big-time.</p></li>
<li><p>As memories get bigger and cheaper and processors get faster, the
number of processor cycles to fetch something all the way from mainline RAM
gets bigger and bigger.</p></li>
<li><p>In a complicated multi-core multi-chip system, message-passing 
latency between core varies dramatically depending on how âcloseâ the cores
are to each other.  Hmm, I feel a new acronym coming on: NuML.</p></li>
<li><p>In recent research, âAutotunersâ have been showing excellent results.
Itâs like this: there are a <em>lot</em> of different ways a compiler can go
about optimizing the code it generates.  Itâs really tough to make the right
choices along many different optimization axes based on your best guess as
to how the underlying hardware will behave.  An autotuner explores the
optimization space by trying random permutations of lots of different settings
while running actual code, and discovers empirically what works best; you run
it once to determine the right 
compiler settings for a particular machine configuration.   Unsurprisingly,
these things can outperform the best guesses of the compiler writers.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id='p-3'>Convincing</h2>
<p>The paper presents a few arguments I hadnât heard before
that had me thinking (without going and plowing through all the supporting
research): that <em>has</em> to be right.</p>
<h3 id='p-4'>Finite Automata </h3>
<p>State machines have long been my personal single favorite piece of Computer
Science.  But the parallelization story isnât good, not good at all.  Which
means they will probably become a little less central to our discipline.
Sob.</p>
<h3 id='p-5'>Multicore vs. Manycore</h3>
<p>Iâd never seen âmanycoreâ prior to reading this, perhaps itâs a term of art
in the Computer-Architecture coffee-shops.  By âmulticoreâ they mean âwhat IBM
and AMD and Intel and Sun are doing nowâ.  By âmanycoreâ they mean, âway more
cores, each simpler, like what the Cisco Metro is doingâ.</p>
<p>They argue that âmanycoreâ buys you more of the performance metrics that
matter.
Sounds convincing.  But also sounds hard to program.</p>
<h3 id='p-6'>Performance Counters</h3>
<p>Historically, some CPUs have had them, but theyâve been low-priority
features that got triaged out when the designers had their back to the
wall.</p>
<p>Which is just silly.  Theyâre easy to design, they donât slow things down,
and in a processor whose design is getting increasingly complex along multiple
dimensions, itâs just not reasonable to ask software designers to live without
them. JIT compilers can use them, big-time.   As the study points out, ideally
youâd like existing programs (existing <em>binaries</em>, even) to run faster
on complex parallel hardware, and without hard data about where the cycles are
going, youâre pushing a hard problem very near the border of âimpossibleâ.</p>
<h3 id='p-7'>Human Results</h3>
<p>The full title of the section is <cite>Programming model efforts inspired
by psychological research</cite>, but thatâs a little misleading.  If I
understand correctly, what they mean is: Study the effectiveness of different
programming models by measuring the results delivered by actual real human
programmers who use them.</p>
<p>Well, dâoh.  Anyone whoâs sat in a bar with a bunch of heavy AOP or 
Lisp wankers will sign up for this one in a flash.   Me, I
do know quite a bit about programming models <em>and</em> I know what I like,
but I donât think Iâm smart enough to predict whatâs going to empower developers to
deliver, whether your efficiency metric revolves around programmer time or CPU
time.</p> 
<p>So letâs, you know, do the experiments and learn from whatever it is they
tell us?   Yes, controlling for all the variables will be hard.  In fact,
there may be some flashes of genius required in pulling together the
experimental methodology. But important science isnât supposed to be easy.</p>
<h2 id='p-8'>Unconvincing</h2>
<p>Mother always said âIf you canât find anything nice to say, donât say
anything.â  But this is Science, so that doesnât apply.</p>
<h3 id='p-9'>Dwarfs</h3>
<p>The study supposes that if you could partition the universe of programming
problems into a few equivalence classes, then by optimizing your system design
for one or more of these classes you could optimize it for the problems that
fall into those baskets.  Which sounds plausible.  They call their baskets
âDwarfsâ because they started with seven of them (the number grew to
thirteen).</p>
<p>Personally, I think all these basket-weaving Dwarfs could be subtracted
from the study without loss of value.  The majority of them apply to
particular sub-disciplines of scientific computing; for example, the first
three are Dense Linear Algebra, Sparse Linear Algebra, and Spectral Methods.
Important stuff for 
people who do Scientific Computing, which is itself important stuff.</p>
<p>But I do
Web computing, which constitutes a not-insignificant proportion of all
computing, and when I consider which Dwarfs I ought to care about, well, Iâm
not sure.  The wiki is a little more helpful than the paper itself, and my
best guess is that I ought to care about
<a href="http://view.eecs.berkeley.edu/wiki/Graph_Traversal">Graph
Traversal</a> and
<a href="http://view.eecs.berkeley.edu/wiki/Finite_State_Machines">Finite
State Machines</a>.</p>
<p>The first suggests that a lot of this computing depends on random memory
access latency, which accords well with my intuitions.  But Iâm not sure that
all those hypothetical dwarfs were a good way to establish this.</p>
<h3 id='p-10'>Data Types and Characters</h3>
<p>The discussion data sizes and types, as they appear in programming models,
seems really weak to me.  Iâm offended that in 2007 intelligent people would
still suggest either that an 8-bit datum is suitable for representing a
character, or that a 16-bit datum is suitable for representing a Unicode
character.</p>
<p>Also, they suggest direct support for âLarge Integer (> 128 bits)â; but
this is hardly news.
Every programming language in the world has this, one way or another; in many of them
(Smalltalk and Ruby at least) itâs built-in to Integer and transparent to the
programmer.  Last time I suggested this might be inefficient I was gently but
firmly corrected by Avi Bryant.</p>
<h2 id='p-11'>Missing In Action</h2>
<p>The paper has surprisingly little to say about what I think is the central
program: what interface should the programmer use when dealing with multicore
or âmanycoreâ systems?  [Oops, in fact it says one
profoundly important thing as I noted <a href="#p-7">above</a>: we ought to
measure the effectiveness of competing approaches to parallelism by measuring
the empirical results achieved with them by programmers].
I had hoped for a bit more insight or some
research results in this space.  They do note that  Software Transactional
Memory is expensive and suggest that with hardware support, it might become
very interesting; but thatâs about all.</p>
<p>It seems that, based on the evidence we have right now, we can draw two
firm conclusions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Conventional thread-based concurrency is âtoo hardâ for the general
population of programmers.</p></li>
<li><p>The combination of functional programming and message-passing (as in
Erlang or MapReduce) makes astoundingly good use of parallel systems and may
well be usable by the average programmer.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, my question: is there anything between #1 and #2?
Who knows the answer?</p>

<p>Well, yes, there was that embarrassing mile-wide hole in telnet (I
havenât used telnet in years except to debug Web protocols, but I guess
someone must; seems to me anyone who leaves telnetd facing the Internet is
exhibiting, uh, questionable judgment; but still.)  Nasty security gotchas are
nothing new in this world, but hereâs something that is new: a
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/tpenta/entry/the_in_telnetd_vulnerability_exploit">first-hand report</a> from the guy who got the 
call you donât want to get, and then got the patch into the system.  Actually, I donât
understand quite a bit of the jargon: âpatch gateâ, âRTI loggingâ, and so on;
but itâs still a compelling story.</p>

<p>Last week, I read about Joyent 
<a href="http://joyeur.com/2007/02/04/a-brief-update-with-some-numbers-for-hardware-load-balanced-mongrels">running
four thousand Rails requests per second</a> with a hardware load balancer fronting
six of their
<a href="http://textdrive.com/hosting/accelerator">Accelerator</a> thingies.
Then yesterday it
<a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/2/10/shiny-new-subversion-and-trac-cluster">turned out</a> that 
<a href="http://svn.rubyonrails.org/rails/">svn.rubyonrails.org/rails</a>,
the new Rails development cluster, is at TextDrive too.  Under my Sun hat Iâm
happy that Solaris is apparently behind the worldâs highest-performance Rails
installation and is supporting both
<a href="/ongoing/When/200x/2006/12/21/Ruby-Server">Ruby 1.9</a> and Rails development.
My take-away, though, is that the more I hear about Joyent, the more
interesting they look.</p>

<p>Last week I spent time talking to a lot of different technology
people, from all over the world geographically and organizationally and culturally.
The conversation kept looping back to Microsoft, and to
the same sentiment: <em>Theyâve lost their mojo.</em>  Lots of people will end
up using Vista, but does anyone <em>care</em>?  The Microsoft execs look
haggard and joyless, and half the interviews feel phoned-in.  Thereâs real
innovation in the Office UI, and everyone says âBut itâs OK, the old keyboard
shortcuts still workâ.  The advertising campaign is vapid and lame, but then
thatâs nothing new; they havenât run an effective one in years.   Iâm sure
that Microsoft can come back, the way IBM did after their bad patch last
century; maybe the energy is building in a building in Redmond where nobodyâs
looking.  Iâve never liked Microsoft, but now I realize how much energy they
used to inject into the ecosystem, because itâs not there any more and I miss it.</p>
